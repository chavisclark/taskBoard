>## TaskBoard Challenge

>Hallo! I've really enjoyed working on this project and becoming more familiar with the technologies at Sharepop.

### See what I've done:
* 1) Integrated Foundation Sites (with Sass)
* 2) Implemented simple responsive design
* 3) Developed editable modal for color and tags
* 4) Implemented drag and drop functionality across lists
* 5) Minimal unit/functional tests



### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Disclaimer

I've never been in charge of testing but I gave it a try anyway!
It's only a few tests.
```
npm test
```

### Things to be improved
* Keep tags from consolidating after list change (possible bug)
* InputBox: Clear input field after after click event. (Currently is only cleared after ENTER)
* Modal: Submit tags on ENTER
* Implement { task, tags, list } remove functionality
* Implement Add New List
* Configure localstorage
* -- These are things that I started, and will implement in the near future --

### Conclusion

Thank you for extending this challenge to me. I look forward to hearing your thoughts regarding any parts of this code.
