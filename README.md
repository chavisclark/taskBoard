>## TaskBoard Challenge

>Hallo! I've really enjoyed working on this project and becoming more familiar with the technologies at Sharepop. I'm running webpack dev server. See what I've done:

1) Integrated Foundation Sites (with Sass)
2) Implemented simple responsive design
3) Developed editable modal for color and tags
4) Implemented drag and drop functionality across lists (I was unable to implement column reordering in time)
5) Minimal unit/functional tests



### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Disclaimer

I've never been in charge of testing but I gave it a try anyway!
It's only a few tests.
```
npm test
```

### Missing Features
1) Reorder tasks on columns

Unforunately I was unable to successfully meet all requirements. 
I will still continue to work on this regardless, because I'm a problem solver!

### Conclusion

Thank you for extending this challenge to me. I look forward to hearing your thoughts regarding any parts of this code.
